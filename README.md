# Darwinex Labs
**Darwinex Labs** is the Prop Investing Arm &amp; Quant Team @ **Darwinex (www.darwinex.com) - The Open Trader Exchange.**

## Who we are

Founded in 2012, Darwinex is a **Broker, Asset Manager and Technology Provider**, authorized and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the United Kingdom. 

The **Darwinex® trademark** and the www.darwinex.com domain are owned by **Tradeslide Trading Tech Limited**, a company duly authorised and regulated by the **Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in the United Kingdom with FRN 586466**.
		
## What we do

In our quest to democratize the financial landscape, we’ve: 

1. Engineered the technology necessary to **wrap trading strategies as an asset class**. The **DARWIN asset/wrapper** lets investors **invest in / trade manager talent, alpha and community sentiment in real-time, while fairly compensating for trader IP**.

1. Eliminated the startup costs and regulatory overhead associated with starting a hedge fund, **enabling under-capitalized talent to compete at institutional scale under our regulatory umbrella** - the foundation of our **Hedge Fund as a Service** business model.

1. Successfully assetized alpha, enabling anyone with access to our community data via the DARWIN API to engineer **investment strategies uncorrelated to any other asset class** in existence.

We’ve hence created an **ecosystem for traders and investors to pool collective talent, information and capital** for private and social benefit, one that:

1. Structurally solves the _“manage peanuts, make peanuts” problem_ faced by under-capitalized talent.

1. Facilitates **merit-driven access to investor leverage with no downside risk**.

## How we do it

These outcomes have been achieved via our proprietary data wrapper - **the DARWIN (Dynamic Asset & Risk-Weighted Investment)** asset, that:

1. Replicates alpha signal in real-time, our algorithmic Risk Manager transforming it to one with a **fixed target Value-at-Risk (95% confidence)** for investors.

1. Enables an **‘apples to apples’ comparison** of all DARWIN assets listed on our Exchange, asset risk comparable to that of a mid-cap stock.

1. Encrypts all underlying transactions both historically and in real-time, thus **protecting trader IP from compromise and dissemination, enabling fair compensation on a high-water mark basis.**

1. Collects **20% performance fees from investor profits on behalf of the alpha generators** providing the signal, and pays the amount to them under our regulatory umbrella.

## The DARWIN Exchange

This transaction between traders and investors is **facilitated through our proprietary marketplace - The DARWIN Exchange - an:

1. Online **“Hedge Fund as a Service”** for traders to list their strategy/data as tradable DARWINs.

1. **“Liquid Alt Amazon for investors”** where investors source talent via a one-stop shop solution including Prime Brokerage, Risk Management and Back-Office

Our technology is bolted on to this Exchange **providing traders with regulatory cover to charge a 20% success fee** on investor profits.		

By doing so, we've built **an ecosystem giving traders equal opportunity**, where **merit alone drives outcomes**. 

Their interests are aligned with ours, as well as those of fellow traders, pooling our collective talent, information and capital for private and social benefit.	
			
## Trading Technology

We offer traders a range of platforms, **access to our liquidity via FIX and a proprietary API offering (DARWIN API)** to trade DARWIN assets on our Exchange.
